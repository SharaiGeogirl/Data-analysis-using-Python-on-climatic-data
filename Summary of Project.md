# Data-analysis-using-Python-on-climatic-data
For my thesis research, I analyzed climatic data, including Chlorophyll-A and Lake surface temperature, to identify potential correlations with cholera
occurrences. Using programming languages such as Python and R, I conducted in-depth analysis and extracted valuable insights that shed light on the complex 
relationship between climate and public health. By leveraging advanced analytical techniques, I was able to identify patterns and trends that could inform 
future research and policy decisions. This project highlights my skills in data analysis and programming and showcases my ability to use data to drive meaningful change
